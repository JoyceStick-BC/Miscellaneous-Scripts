    SoftFlicker will randomily change the intensity of a light.  It works by sampling perlin noise.
    Then, Time.time is used to step through these values smoothly over time. To avoid repetition among lights,
    a random value is generated. The intensity is only changed if the value falls between between minIntensity
    and maxIntensity. By adding a multiplier to Time.time, you can change how rapidly the light flickers.
